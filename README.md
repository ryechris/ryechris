Hi :)

My name is Riyan. I make softwares as a DevOps Engineer.

I do that by means of Development & Operations.

For Development, I program with Go.
I choose Go for its speed and performrance, and because my architecture style is microservices: distributed systems.

Now, that code has to live somewhere; things need to happen to it.
So that's why I also do Ops. 

For Operations, I choose the Cloud. Any cloud theoretically is fine, but you want the most reliable Cloud. For that, I choose the AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
