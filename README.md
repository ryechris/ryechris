Hi :)

My name is Riyan. I make softwares as a DevOps Engineer.

I do that by means of Development & Operations.

For Development, I program with Go.
I choose Go for its speed and performance, and because my architecture style is microservices: distributed systems.
And, also because I find Go the best programming language for concurrency, as well as to exploit fast chips with multiple cores.

Now, that code has to live somewhere; things need to happen to it.
So that's why I also do Ops to build & maintain my own systems. 

For Operations, I choose the Cloud. Any cloud theoretically is fine, but you want the most reliable Cloud. For that, I choose the AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Note: Yes, I was the person who wrote Translingua, the translator app once sold on iOS (until 2022) by Volantiri LLC.
If you want to see my code for that, please contact me; I'll dig up the archives for you.
